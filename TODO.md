# nursery Todo

1. Implement and test `supervisor` functionality and timeout and panic tasks.
1. `const {nurse, superervisor} of Nursery()`?
1. Check Nursery(func) functionality - it doesn't work!
1. Write reference for timeoutTask and TimeoutError
1. Ensure nursery is not used after closing.
1. Retry options like sleep between, error filtering...
1. Change name to pkeeper? Name of package is `keeper-of-promises`? Or maybe creche?
